Project 1 : 
The MLzoomcamp Capstone project aims to develop an image classification algorithm for seven categories 
('airplane', 'person', 'flower', 'fruit', 'cat', 'dog', 'car', 'motorbike') using a dataset available on Kaggle. 
The exploratory data analysis helped standardize image sizes and split the dataset into three parts 
(60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing). Three models were tested: Xception (82.6%), a custom CNN (85.4%), 
and VGG16 (98%). Hyperparameters were optimized to improve performance. The final model is deployed using FastAPI, 
executable locally or via Docker, and was temporarily hosted on AWS EC2. Overall, this project is well-designed and documented, 
offering good reproducibility and an efficient architecture. However, potential improvements could include experimenting with 
other neural network architectures and automating cloud deployment.


Project 2: 
The Uber and Lyft Ride Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model for accurately forecasting Uber ride prices using historical data. 
Key factors considered include distance, time of day, weather, and surge pricing. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent thorough preprocessing, 
including feature engineering and normalization. Various models were tested, with XGBoost performing best. The model was deployed via a Flask API, 
containerized with Docker, and orchestrated using Kubernetes. Future improvements include real-time data integration, deep learning models, 
and a user-friendly interface. This project showcases an end-to-end ML workflow as part of the MLOps Zoomcamp course.
